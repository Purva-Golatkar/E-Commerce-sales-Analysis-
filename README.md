The dataset consists of 50,000 rows where I manipulated and analyzed the dataset using Power BI to track and analyze the online sales of a store across India.

###Enable user driven parameters for visualizations.
###Created connections, join new tables. 

###Data Cleaning.  ###Created measures using DAX.
